			Captain America, The Captain, The Nomad, Steve Rogers. He has been known by many names, but never as constable of the peace!
		</p>
		<p>
			It has a good ring to it, right? A man who has served his country for years by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)">stopping alien invasions</a>, putting an <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/">end to Hydra</a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/">even fighting gods</a> is calling on your help to get elected as the constable in the Fayette County District! 
		</p>
		<p>
			Why should an all American hero who is a decorated soldier be elected for constable? Well, it's very simple, The Captain believes that winning the small battles leads to winning the war! What war? The war on crime and injustice!
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's think about the things that make America great compared to other countries in the world:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Freedom</li>
			<li>Peace</li>
			<li>Pride</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Now let's think about the issues that Captain America is fighting for:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Freedom for all men and women no matter class, race, or religion!</li>
			<li>Peace in our time by fighting the social injustices that have plagued our country!</li>
			<li>Bringing pride back into our country by working hard for the American people!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The captain is willing to fight for his country, put his life down on the line for what he believes in, and speak up against wrong-doers and nay-sayers! All he needs is your vote for Constable in your magistrate district of Fayette County. So show up to vote on November 6th and be sure to pick up your "Constable Captain" button at your local voting station!
